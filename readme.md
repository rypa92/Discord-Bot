This bot was written for some basic functions that I needed within a discord server.
- A way for people to 'vote' for a pokemon that they were interested in.
- A way to store the votes from users, which resulted in the Sheets API from google.
- A way to accept entries for a tournament with relavent information for each entrant.
- A way to store the entrants for later, Sheets API worked fine here as well.
- A way to create a tournament with all the entrants and do the manual work of assigning roles

TODO:
- Add functionality to clear the spreadsheets used in the API for a new tournament.
- Add functionality to automatically delete roles and text-channels when a new tournament is created
- Add functionality for creating roles and text-channels when the tournament it created
